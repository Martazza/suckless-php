# Examples
Every `demo-*` folder in this `examples` folder is a demo website.

E.g. copy the `first-steps` folder in your `/var/www/` and fill `/var/www/first-steps/load.php` with your MySQL/MariaDB database credentials.

Examples:
* `first-steps` It retrieve PHP objects from database results. This example don't need any table.

## Extra files
